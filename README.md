# **Thunder Dragon 2 - No Voices**

This patch removes all of the voices from the Thunder Dragon 2 MAME rom. It has no other effect.


## Patching Instructions:

1 - Extract your MAME Thunder Dragon 2 rom archive (tdragon2.zip).

2 - Using your xdelta patcher of choice, apply the tdragon2-novoices.xdelta patch to the file named "ww930915.3". Make sure that your patched file has the same filename as the original.

3 - Rezip the Thunder Dragon 2 rom archive.
  
  
##### NOTE: When you start up the patched rom, MAME will complain about wrong checksum. This is expected, and can be safely ignored. If necessary, the patching process can be verified using the hashes below:
